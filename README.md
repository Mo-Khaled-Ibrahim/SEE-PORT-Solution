# SEEPORT - Marine Port Management Solution

---

## 🚢 Project Overview

**SEE PORT** is a comprehensive smart solution that helps marine ports run smoother and faster by bringing all cargo, ship, and yard operations into one unified system. With SEE PORT, port managers, operators, officers, and supervisors can track shipments and cargo, manage resources, and handle billing automatically—all in real-time—making daily work easier, reducing mistakes, and helping the port serve ships and clients better than ever before.

### 🎯 Problem Statement
Marine ports traditionally suffer from **scattered data** across multiple systems on operation role level or on different ports level too with no unified database, leading to:
- Inefficient operations management
- Data inconsistencies and errors
- Poor resource allocation
- Delayed decision-making
- Lack of real-time visibility

### 👥 Target Users
- **Port Operators**: Daily cargo and ship management
- **Port Officers**: Customs, security, and documentation
- **Port Managers**: Strategic decision-making and oversight
- **Port Supervisors**: Operational coordination and monitoring

## 📂 Git Repository Structure

The project is organized in a structured Git repository with clear separation of concerns:

### 🗂️ Repository Organization
- **`1. DB/`** - Database implementation and schema with ERD
- **`2. DWH/`** - Data Warehouse and ETL processes using SSIS
- **`3. SSRS/`** - SQL Server Reporting Services reports and dashboards
- **`4. Dashboards sample/`** - Power BI dashboards sample
- **`5. Web App/`** - web application overview

### 📋 Development Workflow
1. **Database First**: Schema design and implementation
2. **ETL Integration**: Data warehouse and transformation processes
3. **Reporting Layer**: SSRS reports for operational insights
4. **Analytics Layer**: Power BI dashboards for strategic analysis
5. **Application Layer**: Web application for end-user interaction

## 📋 Project Development Phases

This project follows a comprehensive development lifecycle covering database design, ETL processes, reporting, analytics, and web application development.

### 🏗️ Phase 1: Database Design & Schema

#### Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)
- **Key Entities**:
  - Ships (IMO codes, specifications, company details)
  - Cargo (containers, types, locations)
  - Voyages (schedules, routes, status)
  - Operations (loading, unloading, customs,...)
  - Employees (roles, permissions, operations)
  - Yards (storage locations, capacity)
  - Docks (berthing, scheduling)

<!-- ERD Image -->

</p>

#### Database Schema Implementation
- **Database System**: Microsoft SQL Server (MSSQL)
- **Features**:
  - Stored Procedures for complex business logic
  - Triggers for data integrity
  - Audting Tables for operators operation history
  
- **Schema Files**: Located in  `1. DB/` directory

### 🔄 Phase 2: ETL & Data Integration

#### SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS)
- **Processes**:
  - Data extraction from source systems
  - Data validation
  - Transformation according to business rules
  - Loading into target database tables
- **SSIS Files**: Located in `2. DWH/` directory

</p>

#### Power BI Dashboards
- **Analytics Platform**: Microsoft Power BI for advanced visualizations
- **Key Insights**:
  - Real-time port operations monitoring
  - Predictive analytics for capacity planning
  - Performance KPIs and trends
  - Resource allocation optimization
  - Revenue and cost analysis
- **Power BI Files**: Located in `4. Dashboards sample/` directory
